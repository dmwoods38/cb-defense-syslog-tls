# READ FIRST

This fork was made to add support for debian-based systems, it just has a shell script that pulls the necessary dependencies and creates the appropriate paths. The CB Defense team has recently created a Dockerfile so you can install the connector on non RHEL-based systems, I recommend using that instead.

# Cb Defense Syslog TLS Connector

This connector allows you to forward alert notifications from your Cb Defense cloud instance into local, on-premise
SIEM systems that accept industry standard syslog notifications. By default, it will generate pipe-delimited syslog
messages containing the key metadata associated with any alert identified by the Cb Defense streaming prevention
system.

The syslog connector will aggregate data from one or more Cb Defense organizations into a single syslog stream.
The connector can be configured to use UDP, TCP, or encrypted (TCP over TLS) syslog protocols.

This connector is distributed as a binary RPM package compatible with any Red Hat or CentOS Linux distribution,
CentOS/RHEL 6.x and above, running on a 64-bit Intel platform.

## Installation

1. Install the software. As root on your Carbon Black or other RPM based 64-bit Linux distribution server:

    ```
    cd /etc/yum.repos.d
    ```
    ```
    curl -O https://opensource.carbonblack.com/release/x86_64/CbOpenSource.repo
    ```
    ```
    yum install python-cb-defense-syslog
    ```

2. Copy the example config file:

    ```
    cd /etc/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog
    ```
    ```
    cp cb-defense-syslog.conf.example cb-defense-syslog.conf
    ```

3. Modify the config file `/etc/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog/cb-defense-syslog.conf` as needed

4. Test the new connector. As root, execute:

    ```
    /usr/share/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog/cb-defense-syslog --config-file /etc/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog/cb-defense-syslog.conf --log-file /var/log/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog/cb-defense-syslog.log
    ```

    Then:

    ```
    cat /var/log/cb/integrations/cb-defense-syslog/cb-defense-syslog.log
    ```

    A successful run will look like:

    ```

    ```

5. Start the connector by enabling it in `cron`. Uncomment the Cb Defense Connector (remove the beginning `#` from the last line) in `/etc/cron.d/cb-defense-syslog`.
   By default, the connector will run once per hour.

## Sample Config File

    [general]

    #
    # Template for syslog output.
